# J-Finder 

# Description: This web scraper application shows the user various software developer job postings based on the results generated by an external website. The user can save time when looking for new job postings by simply refreshing the page. Another feature is the asyncronicity of discarding recruiter based postings as the user refreshes the page. Once the user has found a job they are interested in, they click the breifcase icon and will be directly taken to the page where the job has been posted. These features allow the user to expidite the job search process for new postings.
