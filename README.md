# J-Finder 

# Description: J-Finder is an app that shows software developers jobs they may be interested in. This essentially cuts down the overall job search time.

J-Finder also has a filter that filters out those pesky recruiter false job postings. This further cuts down time for the job hunter from getting distracted by fake job postings.

All you have to do is click on a briefcase and you will be directed to a job!
